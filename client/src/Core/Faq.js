                      time of purchase.

                      <b>A:</b> Buying a registered, purebred puppy means that its family tree is
                      documented as being exclusively one breed. Buying a registered dog does not
                      necessarily mean that the dog will be healthier than a non-registered dog. It
                      means that its parents are of the same breed and that the dog comes from a
                      purebred line. AKC (American Kennel Club) is the most familiar purebred dog
                      registry in the country. There are several other dog registries such as ACA,
                      APR, UKC that also register purebred dogs.

                      <b>A:</b> The microchip registration will begin at the time of purchase. It is
                      extremely important to register your puppies microchip. If your puppy should
                      ever become lost, there is a good chance that your puppy will be recovered if
                      it has a registered microchip. In a pets lifetime, one out of three will
                      become lost. Without enrollment registration and identification about ninety
                      percent will not be recovered.
